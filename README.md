# Grocery System

Do note that this is not a production grade program. It's just a hacky program for a project.

## How to install

If you really want to test out my useful (sarcasm) program then simply:

1. Download the source code and extract it somewhere
2. Open a Terminal inside the project and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
3. Run the program

If you do encounter any bugs then you could submit an issue ticket.
